I am a Manufacturing Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I have experience working in Mechanical Design, NPI and Manufacturing Engineering Development roles. I am also learning basic web development as a side hobby. In my free time I also like messing around with electronics (Raspberry Pi, Arduino and other hardware) and enjoying the outdoors of British Columbia.

Some skills that I have include: Mechanical Engineering, FEA methods, 3D printing strategies, programming (python, go, matlab, C#), SOLIDWORKS and other CAD/CAM suites and much more. Check out my resume for a full breakdown.

Other personal projects I am working on include finding intersections between rock climbing and additive manufacturing for high-performance personalized equipment, and a capstone project working in the polymer composites space.

Please enjoy your time on my site!
